# GAMLj Suite for Linear Models in Jamovi

General, Mixed and Generalized Models module for Jamovi

<img src="docs/i1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">


Estimates a General Linear Model, Mixed Linear Models and Generalized Linear Model (the later yet to be implemented) with categorial and/or continuous variables, with options to facilitate estimation of interactions, simple slopes, simple effects, post-hoc etc.


* Continuous and categorical independent variables
* F-test and parameter estimates
* Moderation made easy
* Simple slopes analysis
* Simple effects
* post-hocs analysis
* Plots for up two three-way interactions
* Automatic selection of best estimation methods and degrees of freedom selection
* Type III estimation
