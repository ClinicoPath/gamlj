Title: GAMLj Suite for linear models
Version: 3.0.8
Author: Marcello Gallucci
Maintainer: Marcello Gallucci <mcfanda@gmail.com>
Description: A suite for estimating linear models, such as the general linear model, linear mixed models,
             generalized linear models and generalized mixed models. For each family, models can be estimated
             with categorical and/or continuous variables, with options to facilitate estimation of 
             interactions, simple slopes, simple effects, post-hoc tests, contrast analysis, effect size indexes, and visualization of the results.
             GAMLj3 is a major rewriting of the GAMLj module. Analyses done with GAMLj version 2.* are not compatible
             with GAMLj3, so they should be opened with the previous version of the module.
